# Project context: Tool Output Injection Attacks

Last updated: 2026-09-14. This is the durable project brief for the researcher,
supervisor, and future Codex sessions. It records the user's initial idea and
supervisor guidance, followed by a separately identified repository assessment.
Update the current-state sections as work progresses; preserve the original intent.

## Original idea supplied by the researcher

Working title: **Idea 2 — Tool Output Injection Attacks**.

### Motivation

Agentic AI systems increasingly rely on external tools such as web search, APIs,
and file systems. Their outputs directly influence agent reasoning,
decision-making, and actions. In practice, tools may return manipulated content,
hidden instructions, or misleading data, and agents may give that material more
authority than it should have.

The initial proposal contrasted this with user-side attacks and identified a gap
in understanding what happens when tool outputs become adversarial inputs. That
is the project's original motivation, not an established claim that prior work
ignores indirect prompt injection. The eventual novelty claim must be narrower
and supported by experiments and a current literature comparison.

**Research question:** How can malicious or manipulated tool outputs influence
agent behavior, and what security risks do they introduce?

### Objectives

1. Investigate how agents process and trust tool outputs.
2. Analyze how malicious outputs alter observable decisions and trigger
   unintended actions, including contamination of tool arguments.
3. Evaluate effects on decision accuracy, task utility, and system safety.
4. Explain propagation from the adversarial source to the security consequence.

Tools participate in the agent's decision-making loop and are a critical attack
surface. Compromised outputs may lead to sensitive data leakage, unsafe actions,
or deviation from the user's intended goal. The longer-term aim is more reliable
interaction between agents and external systems.

### Starting point and move to NeSI

The researcher initially developed this repository on a personal computer, using
Groq's free API. The `codex/agentdojo-lab` branch contains an AgentDojo reproduction
and an independent implementation of NeuroTaint's described methodology, built
with Codex because author code was unavailable to the researcher at that time.
It generates HTML reports to help inspect individual experiments.

Further implementation is to take place on NeSI HPC. The requested first local
model candidate is
[meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct).
Local inference is intended to remove dependence on the previous free API quota;
it is a new experimental backend, not a continuation of the same Groq model runs.

## Supervisor guidance after the demonstration

The next useful step is to **stress-test the existing NeuroTaint implementation
and identify failure cases**, with a small set of concrete examples for the next
meeting. Reproducing another approach or building another large system is not
the immediate objective.

Priority dimensions:

- Multiple sources influencing one action, including sources needed jointly and
  redundant sources for which removing one does not resolve responsibility.
- Argument-level influence: the intended tool can remain unchanged while a
  sensitive value, such as an email recipient, changes.
- Longer propagation chains through several tools.
- Provenance lost through summarization, rewriting, or paraphrasing.
- Information persisted in memory and used by a later session.
- Ambiguous influence judgments and inconsistent conclusions across repeated runs.

For a successful attack, reconstruct the complete path:

> Source → entry point → first divergence → intermediate propagation →
> memory/tool interactions → final sink/action.

The supervisor's motivating example is a malicious document or tool output
entering an observation, changing an argument, being written to memory, surviving
into a later session, and influencing a sensitive call or data disclosure.
Likewise, conceptually `send_email(to=user, ...)` may become
`send_email(to=attacker, ...)`: the research must explain where the new value
originated and how it reached the call. The actual AgentDojo schema uses a
`recipients` list; bind analysis to its real argument paths.

For each meeting example, show the clean and attacked executions, where they
first diverge, how influence propagates, the final consequence, and whether the
independent NeuroTaint implementation identifies the complete path. Provide a
flowchart/attack trace with links to supporting events.

**The central question is:**

> “What important propagation or influence pattern is not reliably captured by
> existing approaches, and why?”

A systematic, reproducible failure pattern could establish a more specific
research gap and later motivate a method or defense. A single failed run, an
unexposed source, or a transport/parser issue is insufficient.

## Implementation and evidence boundaries

The method reference is
[Ghost in the Agent: Redefining Information Flow Tracking for LLM Agents, arXiv v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.23374v1).
Its stated scope already includes semantic transformation, causal influence, and
cross-session persistence. These are therefore dimensions to stress-test, rather
than automatically novel capabilities. See the repository's
[reproduction contract](codebase/agentdojo-lab/REPRODUCTION-CONTRACT.md) for the
declared adaptation and underspecified choices.

The repository records M1–M7 as implemented: policy/exposure bindings, explicit
and semantic cascade, file-memory lineage, isolated single/pair judges,
completed-trace composition, integrations, and the online observer. This is an
independent paper-method implementation under an AgentDojo adapter. It is not
proof of equivalence to author code, original datasets, or original numerical
results. Test coverage and detector accuracy are different claims.

Current evaluation keeps the tracer observational. SafeTool, CTTA, weight
updates, action blocking, and new defenses are outside the immediate pilot.
Experiments use the existing native simulated tools and synthetic sensitive data.

## Current state on NeSI — 2026-09-14

Inspected source baseline: `385de2c` on `codex/agentdojo-lab`. The worktree was
clean before this documentation handoff. Recheck these facts on a later visit.

| Item | Observed state |
| --- | --- |
| Source/configuration/test files | Present in Git |
| Previous raw runs and generated HTML | `runs/` and `reports/` absent on this device |
| Lab environment, AgentDojo checkout, semantic weights | `.venv/`, `vendor/agentdojo/`, `.model-cache/` absent |
| Default Python | 3.9.25; active lab requires 3.12 |
| Local LLM integration | Not implemented: provider validation and primary/auditor endpoints remain Groq-specific |
| Scout weights/server | Not provisioned or started by this handoff |
| Git transport | SSH push and pull tested successfully on this device earlier in the session |
| New case-study pilot | Planned in RESEARCH_PLAN.md; zero new trajectories |

The read-only scheduler assessment found project association `uoa04799` and GPU
nodes; see [HPC_SETUP.md](HPC_SETUP.md) for the dated inventory and feasibility
limits. Scheduler visibility is not proof of a current allocation or available
project GPU-hour balance.

Historical result notes describe successful two-source constructed attacks,
an exact-copy cross-session pilot, and possible early LCS overmatching. Those
are useful leads, but their ignored raw artifacts are not locally available to
reverify. Do not regenerate missing evidence by silently rerunning the models.
The memory copy pilot is not evidence of an actual memory-persistence attack.

The old NT-AgentDojo-Eval-v1 document proposes 120 native trajectories. Its
checked-in ledger records no frozen native plan and zero started trajectories,
despite the older README calling the matrix frozen. The 2026-09-14 guidance
**defers that larger phase** in favor of the small case-study pilot. Original
ledgers and result notes retain their historical values.

## Next actions and unresolved inputs

1. Confirm Hugging Face access to the gated Scout repository, storage location
   and quota, and the usable NeSI GPU allocation. Never place tokens in chat/Git.
2. Restore the pinned lab environment and, if available, selected historical
   artifact bundles from the personal computer. Record missing evidence explicitly.
3. Add an explicit local endpoint path for both primary and auditor clients;
   preserve old Groq protocols. Validate tool-call round trips before experiments.
4. Add a small offline paired report for changed arguments and first observable
   and security-relevant divergence, reusing existing trace/graph exports.
5. Freeze and execute the small case-study protocol in RESEARCH_PLAN.md, then
   examine repeatability only for a clearly specified candidate pattern.

The first unresolved user inputs are Hugging Face approval and the location of
any prior run/report bundles. No new inference, weight download, environment
installation, or Slurm submission was performed during this documentation task.

## Moving between devices

Git syncs tracked code, configurations, and these context files on the selected
branch. It ignores `.env`, lab `runs/`, `reports/`, `.venv/`, `.model-cache/`, and
`vendor/`. Root `/docs/` and `/CODEX_HANDOFF.md` are also ignored, which is why
the durable context lives in these root files instead.

For old experiments, transfer selected complete batch directories and their
linked derived report directories through the researcher's normal file-transfer
route. Preserve relative paths, original bytes, failed/quarantined artifacts,
and manifests. Record the source device, batch IDs, destination, and SHA-256
checks; reverify before analysis. Do not copy credentials with the bundle.
Model and semantic-encoder caches can be separately restored or downloaded at
their recorded revisions. Missing bundles remain missing, not recreated runs.

At the end of a work session, update this status and the research plan, commit
the intended tracked changes, and record whether they were pushed. On the next
device, pull the same branch and let AGENTS.md route Codex to these notes. The
new device still needs its own Git/Hugging Face authentication and environment.
